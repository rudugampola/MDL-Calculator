# MDL-Calculator
This is a simple calculator for calculating the method detection limit (MDL) of a substance. The calculator is based on the guidelines from "EPA Definition and Procedure for the Determination of the Method Detection Limit, Revision 2, December 2016." The calculator is written in Python and uses the Django framework. The calculator is hosted on Heroku and can be found at https://lacsd.herokuapp.com/.

## Definition
The method detection limit (MDL) is defined as the minimum measured concentration of a substance that can be reported with 99% confidence that the measured concentration is distinguishable from method blank results.
